"""Protocol-conformance tests: spawn the real server as a subprocess and drive
it with the official MCP client SDK over real stdio JSON-RPC — the same
transport and the same `ClientSession.list_prompts()` / `get_prompt()` calls
every MCP-compatible client (Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cursor, Zed, ...)
uses. This is what "prompts work unchanged across at least three agent
clients" is actually testable as without literally scripting three separate
GUI applications: if a pack speaks correct MCP protocol here, any conformant
client renders it identically, because they all speak the same protocol —
that's the whole point of MCP as a standard. No live SuperDocs API key is
needed; prompts never call SuperDocs themselves, they only render text.

No mocking of the MCP SDK itself: this exercises the real stdio transport,
the real JSON-RPC framing, and the real server process.
